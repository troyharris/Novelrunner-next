# Active Context

## Recent Changes

### Database Development Environment

- Set up local Supabase instance with Docker
- Created development environment configuration (.env.development.local)
- Added database management scripts to package.json
- Created seed data for development
- Generated TypeScript types from schema
- Documented database workflow in README.md

### Current Setup

- Production database remains active for authentication
- Local database available for schema development
- Migrations tracked in `/supabase/migrations/`
- Seed data in `/supabase/seed.sql`

### Next Steps

1. Test database migrations with local instance
2. Verify TypeScript types are properly generated
3. Ensure development workflow is smooth between local and production environments
4. Document any new database changes in migrations

### Active Decisions

- Using separate .env files for production and development
- Maintaining production auth while developing locally
- Following a migration-first approach for schema changes
- Using TypeScript types generated from the database schema

## Current Focus

The project is in its initial setup phase. The core Next.js application has been bootstrapped with the following structure:

```
/src
├── app/          # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── components/   # (to be implemented)
├── lib/          # (to be implemented)
└── types/        # (to be implemented)
```

## Recent Changes

1. **Project Initialization**

   - Next.js 14+ project created
   - TypeScript configuration set up
   - Tailwind CSS integrated
   - Basic project structure established

2. **Supabase Integration**

   - Database schema implemented with migrations
   - Authentication system set up
   - Client and server configurations
   - Login/Signup flows created

3. **Documentation**
   - Memory Bank initialized
   - Project requirements documented
   - Technical architecture defined
   - System patterns established

## Active Decisions

1. **Database Schema Design**

   - Finalizing data models for:
     - Novel projects
     - Episodes
     - Scenes
     - User settings
   - Planning initial migrations

2. **AI Integration**

   - Evaluating OpenRouter API integration
   - Designing AI persona system
   - Planning feedback format

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Setting up Supabase authentication
   - Designing protected routes
   - Planning user onboarding

## Current Challenges

1. **Technical Considerations**

   - Need to implement database migrations
   - AI integration requires careful rate limiting
   - Real-time updates for collaborative features

2. **UX Decisions**
   - Episode navigation interface
   - Word count tracking implementation
   - AI feedback presentation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority

1. Implement core data models

   - Novel project creation
   - Episode management
   - Scene editor

2. Create basic UI components

   - Navigation structure
   - Project dashboard
   - Episode list view

3. Set up project creation flow
   - New project form
   - Genre selection
   - Word count calculation
   - Episode generation

### Short-term Goals

1. Implement AI integration

   - OpenRouter connection
   - Basic feedback system
   - Initial AI personas

2. Add user authentication

   - Login/signup flow
   - Protected routes
   - User settings

3. Develop manuscript features
   - Scene editor
   - Word count tracking
   - Export functionality

### Medium-term Goals

1. Enhanced AI features

   - Multiple AI personas
   - Context-aware analysis
   - Brainstorming tools

2. Collaborative features
   - Real-time updates
   - Shared projects
   - Comment system

## Open Questions

1. **Technical**

   - Optimal approach for real-time word count updates
   - Best practices for AI rate limiting
   - Storage strategy for large manuscripts

2. **Product**
   - Episode length calculation algorithm
   - AI feedback format standardization
   - Export format options

## Recent Decisions

1. **Architecture**

   - Using Next.js App Router for better performance
   - Implementing server components where possible
   - Utilizing Supabase for real-time features

2. **Development**
   - Following TypeScript strict mode
   - Using Tailwind for consistent styling
   - Implementing progressive enhancement

## Notes

- Project is in initial setup phase
- Focus on core functionality first
- Prioritize user experience
- Build with scalability in mind
